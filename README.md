# Crochet-Stitch-Tracker (In Progress)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This web app is for crochet users who want a simplified way to create advanced, image-based projects. Whether youâ€™re not sure what you want to make yet or youâ€™re following an alpha pattern, this tool helps you visualize and organize your project more easily.

Users can:
- Upload an image (JPG, PNG, SVG)
- Choose a project size (e.g., small t-shirt, throw blanket, etc.)
- Automatically generate a grid that matches their project dimensions
- See stitch counts and color breakdowns
- Highlight and track current working rows
- Add or remove rows
- Save and revisit projects later

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

I crochet myself, and while Iâ€™ve used tools like Stitch Fiddle, I wanted something more accessible and personalized for how *I* work. A lot of tools donâ€™t help you keep track of progress easily, especially with complex or single-color-heavy patterns.

This app is designed to reduce mental strain and make advanced projects more manageable for crocheters of all ages.
